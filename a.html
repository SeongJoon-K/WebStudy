What is a line break in HTML?
A line break is the point at which two lines of text are divided. In HTML, the <br> element creates a line break. You can add it wherever you want text to end on the current line and resume on the next.

The HTML line break element can be used to 
display poems, song lyrics, or other forms of content 
in which the division of lines is significant.

<p>For example, say you’re writing a blog post
 about how to address an envelope or package. 
 You want to include an example of how to format 
 the sender’s and recipient’s addresses. In that case,
</p><p style="margin-top: 45px;">
 you could use the line break element to place the sender’s and
  recipient’s names, street addresses,
 and cities, states, and ZIP codes all on separate lines.</p>
